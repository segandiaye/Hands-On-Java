### ENERCOOP TECHNICAL TEST

This test finds the 5 most frequent IDs in all logs files.

To test this program, simply clone the project and follow these steps:

From the command line:

- `cd ENERCOOP_TEST_HOME`
- `java EnercoopTest.java` (if `java version >= 11`). Otherwise, please first compile it with `javac EnercoopTest.java` and then run it with `java EnercoopTest`.

Or simply use it with your IDE by importing the program.

In this example, the five most frequently used IDs are: [413, 505, 473, 512, 991]

**Note:** We could have used libraries to run this test, but this test is done purely in Java, without calling any other external libraries or using an IDE.
